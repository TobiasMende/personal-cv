## About me
![Picture of me](/images/about-profile.jpg#floatright)
Hi, my name is Tobias and I am a software craftsperson from northern Germany born in 1990.

I studied computer science in Lübeck until 2015. Since then I have worked for Dräger Safety, developing application software using C++ and the QT framework until June 2018. Today I am working as a Remote Software Developer and Architect for PAYONE GmbH (mostly Java).

You can find some but not all of my projects on my [Github](https://github.com/TobiasMende/) account. If you want to know more about my skills, my interests or my history or if you want to connect with me, fell free to take a look on my [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Tobias_Mende/cv) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiasmende/) profiles or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tobias_mende).

In my spare time I enjoy to learn new programming languages and technologies and to develop software in languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python or Objective-C. And I also like traveling, diving, skiing.
