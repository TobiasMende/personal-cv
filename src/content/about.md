Hi, my name is Tobi, and I am a software craftsperson from northern Germany born in 1990.

### TL;DR

After being employed by companies in various domains and of various sizes, I started my own company to help companies to achieve engineering excellence.
With my program _[unblocked.engineering](https://unblocked.engineering)_ I offer coaching and consulting services for companies and teams that want to reach the next
level of engineering excellence and improve their developer productivity.

### The Backstory

Already at the age of six, I discovered my curiosity for computers and technology. I was teaching myself programming and web technologies at the age of 10.

Two years later I started my first company around IT support, web design, and web development. Quickly I realized that software systems can grow quite complex. This sparked the desire to learn approaches to manage this complexity.

Therefore, I started my studies in computer science and software systems architecture. Here I discovered, that not only software systems are interesting and complex, but also social systems are.

During several team projects and while working aside from my studies, I discovered my fascination for sociotechnical systems as the combination of social and technical systems. I was able to nurture and apply this fascination in my following engagements.

I finished my masters degree in computer science with a focus on software systems engineering in 2015 in Lübeck.

Since then, I have worked for [Dräger](https://www.draeger.com/), developing application software, driving the adoption of distributed version control systems and automated tests, implementing continuous integration pipelines across multiple teams and training software engineers on new tools and methodologies until June 2018.

Afterwards, I joined [PAYONE](https://www.payone.com/) as the first Senior Software Engineer in their first remote team. While building up the team, I was working on architecture refactorings, extracting services from monolithic backend systems, developing new features in Java and Kotlin, and facilitating the process of shortening development cycles and simplifying the deployment process.

Today, I am working completely remotely as a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead for [BRYTER](http://bryter.com/). With my team, we are responsible for providing great developer experience for other teams and for enabling them to get their work done faster and better. We introduced continuous deployment processes and reduced pipeline times by roughly 90%. Furthermore, we are helping other teams to adopt new processes and methods that help them to achieve their goals faster and with higher quality. Since establishing the team in April 2021, we fundamentally change the way how teams work at BRYTER.

On the side, I am responsible for the system architecture and for building and launching [Weels](https://weels.site/), a video tool for improving conversion rates on websites _(currently German only)_. Furthermore, I am one of the organizers of the [SoCraTes Germany (Un)conference](https://www.socrates-conference.de/).

Aside from my passion for software craft and finding solutions to complex problems, I enjoy the ocean. In my spare time, I am discovering the hidden world under the surface of the seas while diving. Apart from that, I am enjoying the sun while sailing, windsurfing, or kiting. 

I like to learn new programming languages and technologies and develop software. Furthermore, I appreciate thought-provoking books about leadership and psychology.
